# Digital Image Watermarking Techniques

## Overview

This project explores various digital image watermarking techniques to enhance multimedia security by embedding imperceptible yet robust watermarks in digital images. The primary focus is to ensure copyright protection, content authentication, and tamper detection.

Through extensive research and implementation, the project evaluates methods like **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** and **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, among others, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.
